## LeetCode Solutions in HTML, CSS, and JS
This repository is dedicated to providing solutions to LeetCode problems, presented in a visual and interactive manner using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Every night we will try to solve a LC problem and create and present the solution in an interactive manner!

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves to supplement the text-based solutions you might find on LeetCode and various forums. The solutions are designed to give a clearer understanding of the problem and the corresponding algorithmic solutions by providing a more visual and interactive experience.

## Repository Content

This repository aims to cover as many LeetCode problems as possible. However, the addition of problems and their solutions depends on our progress on the LeetCode platform and the complexity of the problems.

The content of this repository is structured as follows:

1. **HTML**: Describes the structure of the problem and its solution.
2. **CSS**: Styles the HTML to make the visualization more understandable and appealing.
3. **JavaScript**: Contains the actual implementation of the solution, allowing the viewer to interact with the problem and the solution.

## How to Use this Repository

Each LeetCode problem will have its own directory, labeled with the problem number and name. Inside, you'll find three files:

1. `index.html`
2. `styles.css`
3. `index.js`

Open the `problem.html` file in your preferred browser to interact with the solution.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you wish to contribute a solution, please create a new branch, add your solution (ensuring it follows the aforementioned structure), and create a pull request.
